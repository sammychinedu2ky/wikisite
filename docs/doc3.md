- ### Start interacting with the bot by asking questions like:-

    - who is Elon Musk
    - Where is Canada
    - Who is spider man etc
  - Wait a little bit and you would get a response.

You can download the [free basic app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.freebasics&hl=en_ZA&gl=US) on playstore to access Facebook free basics plan on your android device which enables you use the bot without having data on your mobile phone.
  
Most times, if your network is registered under the Free Basic plan, you would be allowed to use the Facebook bot automatically without having data on your device and this really helps you have access to information from wikipedia anytime you want. Please also do note that it is only available by registered network providers that support Facebook free basics.

At this point, we have come to the end of the tutorial. And I hope you enjoyed building the project.
